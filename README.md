# StategraphViewer

Fujitsu Microelectronics developed in cooperation with the Institute for Systems Software (SSW) a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for the definition of HMI systems (human machine interface systems) in the automotive domain. 
This DSL is a text-based programming language for the modeling of state transition models. This state transition models describe the reactive behavior of HMI systems. 
In course of this thesis work a systemâ€“called StateGraphViewer has been developed which generates a graphical representation out of these text-based finite automaton specifications. One important property of this system is that the graphical layout is generated automatically. Therefore 
StateGraphViewer implements special layout algorithms to realize this layout process. 
StateGraphViewer is implemented as an Eclipse plugin and supports the automatic process of text-based finite automata.
